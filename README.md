# Machine and Deep Learning Code and Notes
### Code and Notes on Machine and Deep Learning Algorithms/Techniques using various python libraries
#### Please Note:  Most of the python scripts are labeled with algorithm(s) and libraries used.  Notes and my thought process are commented at the top and between code.  Data sets can be found in MNIST and data set folders.  Table of contents will indicate which algorithm(s), description, libraries and data set is being used for algorithm.
