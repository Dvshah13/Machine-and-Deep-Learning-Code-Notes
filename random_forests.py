# Random Forests considered an improvement over bagged decision trees, changes the algorithm for the way that the sub-trees are learned so that the resulting predictions from all of the subtrees have less correlation.  Decision Trees/CART choose which variable to split on using a greedy algorithm that minimizes error. Even with Bagging, the decision trees have a lot of structural similarities and in turn have high correlation in their predictions.  Random Forests changes this procedure so that the learning algorithm is limited to a random sample of features of which to search. The number of features that can be searched at each split point (m) must be specified as a parameter to the algorithm.  For classification a good default is m = sqrt(input variables)

### Please note: This code is very similar to bagging_decision_trees.py which borrows from decision_trees.py, random forest algorithm application can be found on line 182  ###

# The aim in cross-validation is to ensure that every example from the original dataset has the same chance of appearing in the training and testing set.  In k-fold cross-validation, the original sample is randomly partitioned into k equal sized subsamples. Of the k subsamples, a single subsample is retained as the validation data for testing the model, and the remaining k âˆ’ 1 subsamples are used as training data. The cross-validation process is then repeated k times (the folds), with each of the k subsamples used exactly once as the validation data. The k results from the folds can then be averaged to produce a single estimation. The advantage of this method over repeated random sub-sampling is that all observations are used for both training and validation, and each observation is used for validation exactly once.
