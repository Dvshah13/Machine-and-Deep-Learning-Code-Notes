# Decision Trees/CART is a supervised learning algorithm that is mostly used for classification purposes.  But it also works for both categorical and continuous dependent variables.  In this algorithm, you are trying to split the population into two or more homogeneous sets.  This is done based on the most significant attributes/independent variables to make as distinct groups as possible.  Although they are mostly used for classification purposes, you can also use it for regression predictive modeling problems.  The CART algorithm provides a foundation for important algorithms like bagged decision trees, random forests and boosted decisions trees.  The representation for the CART model is a binary tree.  Each root node represents a single input variable (x) and a split point on that variable (assuming the variable is numeric).  The leaf nodes of the tree contain an output variable (y) which is used to make a prediction

# The aim in cross-validation is to ensure that every example from the original dataset has the same chance of appearing in the training and testing set.  In k-fold cross-validation, the original sample is randomly partitioned into k equal sized subsamples. Of the k subsamples, a single subsample is retained as the validation data for testing the model, and the remaining k âˆ’ 1 subsamples are used as training data. The cross-validation process is then repeated k times (the folds), with each of the k subsamples used exactly once as the validation data. The k results from the folds can then be averaged to produce a single estimation. The advantage of this method over repeated random sub-sampling is that all observations are used for both training and validation, and each observation is used for validation exactly once.
